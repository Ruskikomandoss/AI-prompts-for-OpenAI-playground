Various prompts, sometimes purely for humorous usage, to be pasted into "System" message box within OpenAI's Playground

These represent my learning path towards mastering prompt engineering. Some of them are planned to be of valuable usage, some are just for fun. Feel free to play using them by yourself.

Many of these have elements that are based on methodologies and principles crafted by Dave Shapiro. I give credit where credit is due.
