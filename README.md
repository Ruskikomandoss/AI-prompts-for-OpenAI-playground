Various prompts, sometimes purely for humorous usage, to be pasted into "System" message box within OpenAI's Playground

These represent my learning path towards mastering prompt engineering. Some of them are planned to be of valuable usage, some are just for fun. Feel free to play using them by yourself.

Many of these have elements that are based on methodologies and principles crafted by Dave Shapiro. I give credit where credit is due.

How do you use them? Log into your OpenAI's account, navigate to "Playground" and switch option to "Chat", since it's been set to "Assistants" by default lately. Now you paste the prompt into "System" message box. In order to start with most of them, just hit "Submit" and... enjoy the show.

Concerning further setup, I recommend using the latest language model, as for now it's _gpt-4-1106-preview_. That was the one used to compose, test and produce these.
